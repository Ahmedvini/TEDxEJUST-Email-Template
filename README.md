# TEDxEJUST HTML Email Template

A simple, unofficial TEDx HTML email template designed for reaching out to sponsors, potential speakers, and attendees.

## Background

This template was created as part of the TEDxParculTineretului team's efforts. Faced with a lack of readily available email templates tailored for TEDx events, a designer and technician on the team developed this solution. Now, it's being shared to benefit the wider TEDx community, specifically TEDxEJUST.

## Key Features

*   **Clean and Modern Design:** The template boasts a visually appealing design that aligns with the TEDx brand aesthetic.
*   **Mobile-Responsive:**  Built with responsive design principles, ensuring your emails look great on all devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).
*   **Customizable Content:** Easily modify the text, images, and links to fit your specific event details and messaging.
*   **Social Media Integration:** Includes prominent social media icons, making it simple for recipients to connect with your TEDxEJUST event online.
*   **Clear Call to Action:** Designed to encourage engagement, whether it's registering for the event, learning more about sponsorship opportunities, or confirming speaker participation.

## Two Color Variations

The template comes in two color variations:

1. **White Background (`email wTEMP.html`):** Ideal for a brighter, more traditional email look.
2. **Black Background (`email bTEMP.html`):** Offers a sleek, modern feel that can make your content stand out.

## How to Use

1. **Choose Your Template:** Select either `email wTEMP.html` (white) or `email bTEMP.html` (black) based on your preference.
2. **Open in a Text Editor:** Use a plain text editor (like Notepad++, Sublime Text, or VS Code) or an HTML editor to open the chosen file.
3. **Customize the Content:**
    *   **Replace Placeholder Text:** Update the `Lorem ipsum` text with your event details, speaker information, sponsor messages, etc.
    *   **Update Images:** Change the image `src` attributes to point to your own images (logos, speaker headshots, etc.). You can host these images online and use the URLs in the template.
    *   **Modify Links:** Adjust the `href` attributes for social media links and any other calls to action to direct to the correct URLs.
    *   **Edit Styling (Optional):** If you're comfortable with CSS, you can further customize the appearance of the template by modifying the `<style>` section within the `<head>` of the HTML file.
4. **Save Your Changes:** Save the modified HTML file.
5. **Send Your Email:**
    *   **Use an Email Marketing Service:** For sending to a large audience, consider using an email marketing platform (like Mailchimp, Sendinblue, or Constant Contact). These services can import HTML email templates.
    *   **Send Directly (for smaller lists):**  You can copy the rendered HTML content from a web browser (by opening the HTML file in your browser) and paste it directly into your email client's compose window. Be sure to test how it looks in different email clients.

## Important Notes

*   **Image Hosting:** Ensure your images are hosted online and accessible via public URLs.
*   **Email Client Compatibility:** Test your email in various email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail, etc.) to ensure it renders correctly across different platforms.
*   **Inline CSS:** This template uses inline CSS for styling to maximize compatibility with email clients. Avoid using external CSS files.
*   **TEDx Guidelines:** Always adhere to the official TEDx branding and communication guidelines when using this template.
